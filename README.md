# AI-Connect4-Game-Agent
This is a Python implementation of the Connect Four game with an AI opponent. The AI uses either the minimax algorithm or a simplified scoring approach to make its decisions. The game is played on a 6x7 grid, and the goal is to connect four game pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
